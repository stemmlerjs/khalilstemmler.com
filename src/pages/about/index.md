I'm Khalil, a full-stack javascript developer available for hire.

I fell in love with coding and tech ever since my first programming class in Grade 9. 

Since then, I've earned my Bachelors in Computer Science, my Diploma in Internet Networking and worked at companies of varying size such as IBM, Pinnaca Softcorp, and JOMAR in Software roles learning and building things, mostly with JavaScript and NodeJS.

My freelance journey began while I was in school in school in order to pay the bills while I was studying Computer Science. It was a _fun_ time of balancing school between building apps, websites and tools for clients. 

Towards the end, I built [Univjobs](https://univjobs.ca), an online job marketplace for Canadian post-secondary students and recent graduates, during my final years of study.

I write and speak about JavaScript, web design, development and music.

When I'm not hacking away, I'm usually spending time with loved ones or making [music](https://soundcloud.com/cyanidecanaries/sets/cyanide-canaries-a).
