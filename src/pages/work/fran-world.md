This is a portfolio website that I created for the wonderful designer, Francesca Morreale.

She had already created the high fidelity wireframes for desktop and mobile, I just coded it up for her. 

Because she's a designer and knows how to code, it was created using jQuery and HTML so that she could make edits to it later.
