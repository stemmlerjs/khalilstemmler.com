Health Espresso is a mobile virtual care giver for iOS and Android equipped with voice reminders of medication timings, doctorâ€™s appointments, and health related notifications. 

I was the software architect for this project and worked with the team in Sprint 0 to plan the project sprints.

## Drug to drug microservice
After the MVP was built, I was asked to build a feature onto the app that would alert users if the medication that they're about to add will have any interactions with their current medication.

I built the Drug-to-drug interaction microservice using NodeJS, Redis and PostgreSQL.

Since the service, Drugbank, charges based on the number of request per month, I predicted that I was able to save my client money exponentially over time by caching and saving the interactions.
