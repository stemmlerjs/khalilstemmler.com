<!--
This was a really fun experiment that allowed me to learn more about Asterisk and Twilio simultaneously.

The goal was to figure out how to extend the Asterisk PBX Linux software to add text notifications when I miss a call on my VoIP phone.

Using NodeJS, I wrote a script that hooked into the Asterisk Management Interface and watches for state changes that signify a missed call happened. To notify me, I used Asterisk to send an SMS text to my cell phone.

I actually wrote a blog post about this [over here](/2016/09/21/asterisk/) if you're interested.

[Check out the code on GitHub](https://github.com/stemmlerjs/Asterisk-Twilio)

Details not up yet. It will be soon, though.
