"A music sequencer is one of the most important pieces of equipment we use in our home studios. It's where we record, edit, and process a lot of the electronic drum, bass, and synth parts created for our productions." - [practical-music-production.com](http://www.practical-music-production.com/music-sequencer.html)

I created this music sequencer back when I first started getting into web development some number of years ago.
