Lynch Fluid Controls Inc designs and manufactors hydraulic motion control manifolds and integrated hydraulic systems.

I had the opportunity to help Lynch save money by creating a robust Business Intelligence application using React, Redux, and PHP using the Slim Framework.

Working with a team of 3, I architected a software solution that would integrate with their SAP database to automatically track and evaluate the profitability of standard products on a real time basis. 

The application also provided all services online and generated reports/notifications to support management and planning teams.

Unfortunately, I can't share any code or screenshots for this application because I signed a **non-disclosure agreement**. If you're curious, I'd be happy to talk more about the problem I helped solve.
