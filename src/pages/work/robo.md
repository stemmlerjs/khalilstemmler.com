My robo-buddy is a hackduino made from scratch based on the $3 ATMEGA168 microchip. His whole thing is that he looks around for slim profiled objects (pencils, rods) and comically slams himself into them. He's not interested in wide-profiled objects (like flower pots). Literally, his entire purpose is to make people laugh.

Details not up yet. It will be soon, though.
