Univjobs is a platform that I built in my last two years of university. It's currently being used by a few thousand students and a few hundred employers in Canada.

It was built in response to the frustration that our peers in STEM and non-STEM fields felt trying to find entry-level jobs and part-time work while in school.

## Frontend 
- React 16 application
- State management via Redux
- CSS Modules Webpack config
- JSLint and Prettier Pre-commit hooks
- Hosted on AWS S3 

## Backend
- Node + Express Microservices (6 of them running on PM2)
- Microservice architecture hosted on AWS via Elastic Beanstalk
- Auth with Node and Redis
- Mocha with Chai assertions for Unit tests
- Supertest for testing API routes
- GitLab CI pipeline (staging, production)

### Design process

When we started designing Univjobs, we decided to follow the steps outlined by [Black Design](http://www.black.design/), since they had learned the hard way and built a good system by doing this with many Y Combinator startups.

This helped us figure out exactly what was going to be in our MVP.

Altogether, it took us about 8 months to launch a beta while building the app in-between classes and co-ops.

In Sept 2018, we launched an alpha version, iterated on the design quite a few times, and continue to make the platform better outside of our full-time jobs and hobbies.

### Development

<div style=" font-size: 14px; margin-bottom: 20px;">I certainly was busy this last year.</div>

Some of my best work has been on this platform. I got a chance to use only the most modern and powerful technologies to build it. Most of the work I've done is in my private Gitlab account. If you'd like to see a code sample or see the codebase, [reach out](/contact) and I'd be happy to show you.
